# StARS: Structural Alignment Risk Scoring Framework
### The Mena Dominance Law Engine

**Current Version:** v2.0 (Patent-Aligned Prototype)
**Author:** Arlex Orlando Murcia Mena
**Status:** Patent Pending | Active Development

## 🚀 Overview
The **Structural Alignment Risk Scoring (StARS)** framework is a proprietary diagnostic architecture designed to quantify and regulate entropy in complex sociotechnical systems (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions, AI models).

Unlike traditional risk models that treat failure as a homogeneous event, StARS decomposes systemic misalignment into two chemically distinct vectors:
1.  **Agent Stress Load (ASL):** The entropic load carried by the intelligent agent (burnout, moral injury, computational fatigue).
2.  **Code Vulnerability (CV):** The structural fragility of the governing system (protocol complexity, conflicting KPIs, policy gaps).

## ⚖️ The Mena Dominance Law
This repository implements the **Mena Dominance Law**, a fundamental conservation law for organizational stability:

> **$\Delta = ASL - CV$**

The system calculates a **Dominance Differential ($\Delta$)** to enforce a **Dual-Path Corrective Mandate**:
* **Structure-Dominant ($CV > ASL$):** Deviation is driven by architecture. Corrective action MUST target the structure (e.g., protocol simplification). Targeting the agent increases entropy.
* **Agent-Dominant ($ASL > CV$):** Deviation is driven by the agent. Corrective action MUST stabilize the agent (e.g., workload reduction).
* **Mixed Dominance ($ASL \approx CV$):** Requires synchronized dual-path intervention.

## 🛠️ Features (v2.0)
* **Deviation Diagnostic Engine (DDE):** Real-time calculation of ASL and CV composite scores.
* **Rosetta Stone Module (Claim 22):** Auto-mapping engine that translates domain-specific logs (e.g., "Latency," "Burnout") into standardized vector inputs.
* **Correction Decision Engine (CDE):** Automated generation of legally compliant corrective mandates.
* **Domain Profiles:** Pre-configured weighting for Hospital, Justice, and Cloud Infrastructure domains.
